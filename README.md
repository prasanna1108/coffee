# Problem Statement:
The goal of this project is to analyze coffee sales data from a vending machine to identify sales trends, customer purchasing patterns, and predict future sales. The dataset contains detailed records of transactions from March 2024 to the present. Using time-series exploratory data analysis and machine learning models, the project aims to predict next day/week/month sales, analyze specific customer purchases, and provide insights for optimizing inventory management, vending machine layout, and sales strategies.
